	Welcome to the intro kit. What you're reading right now is a comment. There are many comments throughout this kit to show you what to do. Comments show up in the color of this text.

	You will be working in a project that has a lot of pieces. It's OK not to understand all of them right away! You'll get there. 

	To get started, open your web browser (chrome pls), find this file, and open it.

	Then, find the comment that says STEP 1:::: and follow the instructions there.

		STEP 1:
		You found me! Let's learn about classes! A class is like a name you can give to one or more items on a page. This name can be used to control all sorts of behavior for that item, but we'll stick to size, shape, and color for now. 

		Look at the divs below. They say class="box red" or class="box blue". Right now, if you look at the file in the browser, you will only see one blue box. That's because the red box is commented. Go ahead and delete the comment indicators, save the file, then refresh your browser and see what happens!

		Good job, you made the red box appear! Now, try changing the 'red' to another color, like 'yellow' or 'orange', refreshing your browser each time to see what happens. 

		DID YOU KNOW: What's going on under the hood is that, if you look in the file "styles.css" on line xxxx, you'll see a bunch of different selectors, or things that look like .red {} or .blue {}. This is telling the computer to apply styles inside the {} to anything with those particular classes. We've already written the styling for you, you're just hooking up the div to each style block. Pretty neat, huh?

		NEXT: Alright, now that you're a div master, find STEP 2 on this page and move on. (there is no STEP 2).
